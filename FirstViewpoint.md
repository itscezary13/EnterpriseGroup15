Transformation of streaming services (Physical media to Netflix/Spotify) 

(FIRST VIEW POINT) 

 

From a positive viewpoint, the shift from physical media to streaming services has changed entertainment in a way that feels pretty natural for how people live today. Not long ago, watching a movie or listening to an album meant owning a DVD or a CD, and for many people that also meant spending a lot of money and finding the space to store everything. Streaming basically removed those limits. With platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Disney+, you don’t have to buy each piece of media separately—you just pay a small monthly fee and suddenly have access to thousands of movies, shows, and songs. For a lot of families and students especially, this makes entertainment cheaper and easier to access. 

One of the biggest improvements is convenience. Instead of needing a DVD player or carrying around discs, people can watch or listen to whatever they want on their phones, laptops, tablets, or TVs. This flexibility fits into everyday routines much more smoothly. You can finish a show on your phone during a bus ride, then continue it at home without even thinking about it. Physical media could never really offer that kind of instant, mobile experience. The speed is another big advantage—there’s no waiting for something to be delivered or searching through store shelves. Everything is just there when you want it. 

Streaming also helps people discover more content. Because platforms pay attention to what users watch or listen to, they make suggestions that actually feel relevant. This means people often find new artists, genres, or films they wouldn’t have noticed on their own. It’s a simple feature, but it plays a huge role in expanding people’s tastes and helping them explore beyond whatever is most popular at the moment. 

Another important part of this shift is how it affects creators. In the past, getting a film distributed or releasing an album depended heavily on physical production, shipping, and store sales. Now, artists can share their work worldwide just by uploading it to a streaming platform. This has opened up opportunities for smaller creators, independent musicians, and international producers who might have struggled to reach large audiences through traditional methods. As a result, streaming has helped bring more diverse voices and stories into the mainstream. 

Overall, moving from physical media to streaming has made entertainment more accessible, affordable, and flexible. It has changed how people interact with media day-to-day and has given both audiences and creators more freedom. For most people today, it would be hard to imagine going back to relying only on DVDs or CDs, which shows just how big of a difference streaming has made.
