Introduction:

Long gone are the days of DVDs, CDs and VHS tapes. Today's consumer much prefers subscription-based eat-it-all services such as Netflix, Spotify or Disney+. This shift is not simply a niche trend but both a cultural and industrial transformation that has reshaped contemporary entertainment forever. Improvements in digital technology, more widespread access to the internet and change in customer expectation all enabled this revolution that has changed the way media is produced, distributed and consumed all around the world. It no longer is just about the convenience of being able to watch the newest episode of "Stranger Things" on your phone, subscription based streaming has made a major impact not just on the industry but also on every one of ours day-to-day lives. The streaming giants we all know and love all reshaped existing business models, altered the concept of ownership of media and introduced various economic, cultural and ethical considerations not many would even thought of before streaming became accessible to almost anyone on the planet. The aim of this case study is to analyse this shift and critically assess its everlasting impact on both the consumers and media producers. We will analyse (viewpoint 1) and (viewpoint 2) to seek a balanced understanding of all the good and the bad impact of subscription-based streaming services.
