Transformation of streaming services (Physical media to Netflix/Spotify) 

(First ViewPoint) 

(From a Societal Viewpoint) 

Looking at the shift from physical media to streaming from a societal perspective, it’s clear that this change has affected the way people interact with entertainment and with each other. Before streaming, watching a movie or listening to an album usually meant owning a DVD or CD. This not only cost money but also limited what people could access based on their location or the stores nearby. Now, with platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Disney+, people can access huge amounts of content instantly and for a low monthly fee. This makes entertainment more available to everyone, regardless of social or economic background, which is a big change for society as a whole. 

One of the main ways streaming has impacted society is how we consume media socially. People no longer have to stick to a broadcast schedule or wait for physical copies—they can watch or listen on their own time. This has changed how communities discuss entertainment. For example, people can binge-watch a new series over the weekend and then talk about it online or with friends during the week. Social media, fan groups, and online forums have made it easier than ever to connect with others over shared interests. In many ways, streaming has helped build communities around content and brought people together across the world, which just wasn’t as easy in the era of DVDs and CDs. 

Streaming also exposes people to more diverse cultures and ideas. Algorithms and recommendations often suggest shows, movies, or music that people wouldn’t have discovered otherwise. This introduces audiences to new cultures, languages, and creative styles, helping society become more aware of different perspectives. Independent creators, international artists, and smaller productions can now reach audiences globally, instead of being restricted by the limits of traditional physical media. This has helped broaden the cultural conversation and allowed more voices to be heard. 

Finally, the convenience of streaming has changed daily life. People can watch or listen anywhere—on their phones, tablets, laptops, or TVs—and it fits into modern, busy lifestyles. Entertainment has become more flexible and integrated into people’s routines, from commuting to relaxing at home, which also affects how people socialize and share experiences with others. 

Overall, looking at this transformation from a societal perspective shows that streaming has made media more accessible, fostered cultural diversity, and strengthened social connections. It has changed not just what we watch or listen to, but how we experience and share entertainment in our communities.
