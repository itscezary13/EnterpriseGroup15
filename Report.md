Long gone are the peak days of DVD's, CD's and VHS tapes. Nowadays, users around the globe much prefer subscription based services such as Netflix, Spotify and Disney+. This change is not just a niche trend but both a cultural and Industrial Revolution in both music and entertainment industries. This shift was caused by improvements in digital technology, more widespread internet access and changes in customer expectations. It no longer is just about the convenience of being able to watch the newest episode of "Stranger Things" on your phone. Modern streaming services made a major impact on our day-to-day lives and how we consume content. The streaming giants revolutionised existing business models, altered the concept of ownership of media and introduced various economic, cultural and ethical considerations not many would even have thought of before entertainment became accessible to anyone with internet access. The aim of this case study is to analyse this shift and critically assess its impact on both consumers and enterprise involved. We will discuss the historical development of it, look at Business & Societal viewpoint and seek a balanced ethical reflection of all the good and bad streaming did for us. 

Many believe that physical media consumption bloom in the 1960s when Lou Ottens, who worked for Philips, proposed the first ever audio cassette at the 1960 Berlin Radio Show (1). This relatively compact device enabled listening portably, which challenged the domination of vinyl records at the time (2). Towards the end of the 1970's the idea of a portable music player was further looked into by Sony, which introduced the famous Walkman in 1979 (3). This device was a small cassette player that turned listening to music into an individual experience. The popularity of the Walkman had an impact on the music scene with the popularisation of the so-called "Mixtape Culture" (4). In the early 1980's the two technological giants decided to work together to create the Compact Disc, more commonly known as a CD. The collaboration was a success as in 1982 the format was brought to marker with the introduction of Sony's CDP-101 player (5). CD became the most popular physical format in the early 1990's (6).

Meanwhile, the video media market had a revolution of its own. In the mid-1970's Sony has released the VHS format which quickly became the standard way to consume content (10). The VHS tapes were later reimagined into DVD's in the 1990's Similarly to CD's, they were a more compact and convenient way to consume media.

The rapid changes did not slow down in the 90s as researches at the Fraunhofer Institute developed the MP3 file format. It was a way to compress audio recordings to reduce sizes of files while preserving music decent quality of media (7). The reduction of the sizes of music files enabled easier file sharing between users. We quickly entered the 'Peer-To-Peer' era by 1999 with the introduction of a file sharing platform called Napster (8). The software's users were able to share MP3 files between each other completely for free. This meant that one CD sale could be distributed between hundreds on Napster. As you can imagine, music rights-holders were not thrilled with the development. The platform faced many legal troubles in the years succeeding its premiere. It is estimated by the RIAA that around $15 Billion of revenue was lost because of Napster in the US alone. In 2001, the service was shut down due to a court's verdict (9).

In the early 2000s it was clear that the idea of free, accessible and unlimited media was simply too good to forget for the consumers. Digital formats (mainly MPEG-1 and MPEG-4) let work begin on first video streaming platforms (11). 2000's also saw the birth of legal digital music. Most notably, Steve Jobs' Apple has launched the iTunes Store which offered legal music downloads for as low as 99 cent per song. Alongside the store, the company also released the iPod, a device able to play mp3 files through headphones without physical media carrier (13). In 2005 Google's YouTube has launched offering mostly user-generated video content. Towards the end of the 2000s Netflix shifted from DVD rentals into subscription-based VOD. On the music front, Daniel Ek introduced Spotify which offered licensed music available through internet. The app's business model is known as freemium meaning that it operates for free with ads with an option of a paid plan (12).

Streaming media grew in popularity after 2008. Apple introduced iTunes movie rentals and Netflix expanded to TV apps on Roku and Xbox. Main reason why streaming grew so much in popularity were the advancements in internet speeds. Broadband was a lot more common in households. By early 2010s streaming services stopped purely licensing content. Netflix's 2013 classic "House of Cards" was a revolution of how media is consumed releasing all of its episodes at once. 2010s are usually known as the streaming era in terms of media consumption.

There was a lot of criticism of streaming, particularly in the music industry. After Spotify went global in 2011, the platform amassed 15 million paying by 2014 (14). Plenty of artist criticised the platform for, what they felt like, unfair pay system. Most notably, American star Taylor Swift pulled her entire catalogue from the platform in protest (15). Many artists would follow suit but because of Spotify's growing popularity most of them would come back, including Swift. A solution to the paying disputes was proposed in 2017 by American rapper Jay-Z with the launch of Spotify's competitor named Tidal. On launch he promised higher music quality combined with better pay for artists. Upon premiere many artists would release their albums exclusively on Tidal, examples include Kanye West's 'The Life of Pablo' or Rihanna's 'Anti'. Despite the heavy promotion, Tidal would never see success comparable to that of Spotify.

The streaming marker saw a lot more competition over the next years beginning the era of so-called "streaming wars". Media distributors and rightholders preferred to launch their own services (Warner Bros launched HBO Max and Disney had Disney+) rather than licensing their content to maximise revenue. This offered variety but took away one of streaming's first pros, ability to watch whatever you want wherever you want. In the current state of streaming, paying for all available services would cost the same, if not more, as traditional means like cable or DVD's. Especially with the introduction of ad tiers and bundles, streaming starts to resemble the product it aimed to replace in the first place.

From a business point of view, streaming has changed a lot about how entertainment companies work. Before all of this, most companies relied on people buying DVDs, CDs or digital copies. They made money only when something new was released. Once streaming became normal, everything shifted to monthly payments instead of one-time purchases. This gave companies a steady income, which makes planning much easier for them.

Netflix is a good example of how powerful this model can be. In 2024, they added over thirteen million subscribers in just one quarter, which led a lot of analysts to say Netflix was clearly leading the streaming industry at that point [[1]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/netflix-soars-earnings-highlight-dominance-streaming-wars-2024-01-24/). When a company grows like that and knows that money is coming in every month, it becomes a lot more confident in spending on new shows, films and global expansion.

Music streaming shows the same idea. Spotify has almost seven hundred million monthly users now and still holds the largest share of the music streaming market. It also stays ahead of Apple Music and Amazon Music, which shows how competitive the industry is and how hard it can be for smaller platforms to even survive [[2]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/spotifys-daniel-ek-become-executive-chairman-soderstrom-norstrom-named-co-ceos-2025-09-30/) [[3]](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/uk-watchdog-launch-investigation-into-music-streaming-2021-10-19/). Most people just pick the biggest service because it has the most content, and this makes the gap between companies even wider.

There has also been a big shift in what customers are actually paying for. Instead of owning something permanently, people now pay for access. In the UK, streaming became more than half of record label income by 2018, which shows how fast this model took over [[5]](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/21/streaming-accounts-for-more-than-half-uk-record-label-income). Some people argue that the value feels different now because the moment you stop paying, everything disappears. The Guardian pointed out that this can make people question what they are really buying when they subscribe to a service like this [[4]](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/02/streaming-spells-the-end-of-the-ownership-era-of-music-but-are-we-ready-to-let-go).

Another major issue is content licensing. Platforms like Netflix cannot offer the same shows in every country because rights are sold separately. This is why different regions have different libraries. A lot of users have tried using VPNs to get around this, but Netflix has had to block them due to pressure from studios and regulators [[7]](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/in-asia-netflix-trips-on-regulation-content-and-competition-idUSKCN0XJ0D2/). On top of that, many major studios have removed their shows from Netflix to start their own platforms. Shows such as Friends and The Office were pulled when the owners launched competing services, which forced Netflix to spend more on original content [[6]](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/02/netflix-faces-losing-licensed-hit-shows-to-streaming-rivals).

Competition in the streaming industry has increased quickly. Disney Plus is probably the best example. It reached one hundred million subscribers in around sixteen months and, when combined with Hulu and ESPN Plus, even passed Netflix at one stage. Disney used its big brands like Marvel and Star Wars, and this helped them grow extremely fast [[8]](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/11/how-disney-overtook-netflix-in-streaming-wars). Because of this, companies have had to spend even more on exclusive content to keep people subscribed.

Investor pressure affects streaming platforms too. Netflix had a major stock drop in 2022 after losing subscribers for the first time in years. Investors were worried about the future, and this pushed Netflix to introduce new plans like a cheaper option with ads and restrictions on password sharing [[9]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/netflix-feels-heat-pandemic-boom-fizzles-2022-04-20/). Spotify has faced challenges as well. It pays a lot in royalties, which makes it harder to make a profit. However, Spotify reported its first annual profit in 2024 after raising prices in more than one hundred fifty countries and expanding further into podcasts and audiobooks [[10]](https://www.reuters.com/business/spotify-forecasts-profit-above-estimates-user-growth-price-hikes-2025-11-04/).

Looking at the business side of streaming shows both the benefits and the difficulties. The model helps companies grow quickly and reach global audiences, but it also comes with issues like licensing restrictions, rising costs, tough competition and constant pressure from investors. If streaming companies want to stay strong in the long run, they need to balance growth with stability while still thinking about what users and creators need.

When streaming moved from a nice extra to the normal way people watch and listen, it didn't just change entertainment, it changed power. Companies like Netflix and Spotify now sit in the middle of how we access films, series and music. That creates a lot of ethical questions that are easy to ignore because everything feels quick and convenient for the user. In this section, I'll be looking at some of the main problems I see with the current streaming model, and then suggest changes that could make it fairer and more responsible.

One of the most obvious ethical issues is how hard it can be to leave a service once you've joined it. Many digital platforms have been criticised for using dark patterns, which are design tricks that push people into choices they might not have made if everything was clear and simple. A recent review of online services in Europe found that a large majority of sites and apps still use at least one dark pattern in their design, often hiding information or making some options much more confusing than others [1]. We can see the same problems in big subscription services. For example, Amazon had to settle a major case in the US after regulators accused it of using deceptive designs that made Prime easy to join but much harder to cancel [2]. Even if streaming platforms are not breaking the law, it is still a problem if users feel like the system is set up to keep them paying rather than respecting their choices. A model that depends on people forgetting to cancel or getting lost in menus isn't just annoying, it's ethically weak.

Another serious issue is data and transparency. Streaming services track what we watch, when we watch it and on which devices. So in theory, this is to improve recommendations, but it also turns our behaviour into a valuable resource for the company. This becomes an ethical problem when people aren't properly informed about what is collected and why. In 2024, the Dutch Data Protection Authority fined Netflix 4.75 million euro because the company failed to clearly explain to customers how their personal data was being processed and didn't give good enough answers when people asked what information was stored about them [3]. To me, this shows that even very large and experienced companies still treat privacy as something they can fix later rather than a basic responsibility. If users don't understand how their viewing history and profile data are used, they can't really give real consent and they can't judge the risks for themselves.

There is also a fairness problem when we look at who benefits from the streaming model. For users, subscriptions feel cheap because the cost is spread out. For big platforms and very famous artists or studios, the system can be extremely profitable. However, many smaller musicians and independent creators say they receive only a tiny amount per stream and that it's almost impossible to earn a living unless they have millions of plays. Recent reports suggest that Spotify pays only a few dollars per thousand streams on average, while other platforms pay a bit more, and that most of the money still flows to a small group at the top [4]. At the same time, some artists are leaving the platform altogether because they feel the company’s decisions, such as investing heavily in other industries, don't match the values of the creative community that actually generates the content [5]. When the people who make the work feel exploited or ignored, that raises ethical questions about how streaming platforms share value and how much control creators really have.

Another ethical dimension is the environmental impact. Compared to producing and shipping DVDs, streaming looks clean because everything is digital. But the video still has to travel through data centres and networks that use a lot of energy. The International Energy Agency estimated that one hour of video streaming in 2019 produced around 36 grams of CO2 on average, which sounds small until we remember that billions of hours are streamed every year [6]. The World Economic Forum has also highlighted how the rapid growth in internet traffic from video, games and calls is pushing data infrastructure to keep expanding, which means more servers, more cooling and more electricity [7]. Streaming is still generally better than everyone buying physical copies, but it's not impact free. When a whole industry moves to this model, I think it's fair to expect companies to show clearly what they're doing to keep the footprint as low as possible.

For users, there's also a quieter ethical issue around control and dependence. When we bought DVDs or CDs, we owned something that couldn't just suddenly vanish. With streaming, access is linked to contracts, licences and algorithms that the user doesn't see. Films and series can disappear overnight when deals change. Music can be removed after disputes. Whole libraries are sometimes reduced because a platform wants to cut costs [6]. This makes culture feel temporary and fragile, even though it sits in huge corporate archives. It raises questions about who gets to decide what's available, what's promoted and what quietly drops out of sight [6].

If streaming services want to be more ethically solid, they have a lot of realistic options. The first and most obvious one is to fix cancellation and sign up flows so that they're genuinely balanced. Cancelling should be possible in one or two clear steps from the account page, with straightforward language and no guilt messages. Regulators in the EU and US are already moving in this direction, but platforms could choose to lead rather than wait to be forced [8]. Making exit as easy as entry would show that companies are confident in their value instead of relying on confusion.

Second, platforms need to treat privacy as part of the product, not as an afterthought hidden in a long policy. They could just provide a simple dashboard where users can see the main categories of data that are stored about them, why each category exists and how long it's kept. Inspired by the Netflix case, they could also provide clear tools so that people can easily request, download or delete their data without going through a complicated support process [3]. This wouldn't just reduce the risk of future fines, it would show respect for users as people rather than just as data points.

Third, there's room for more ethical innovation in how money is shared with creators. One idea that's already being discussed is a user centric payment model where a subscriber’s fee is divided only between the artists or shows they actually consume, instead of going into one big pool [9]. This wouldn't magically fix the problem of low overall payouts, but it might feel fairer and give niche creators a better chance if they have a small but loyal audience. Platforms could also be more open about their revenue splits and commit to minimum payment levels or bonus schemes for independent creators, instead of keeping the exact formulas vague [4].

On the environmental side, streaming companies should be more transparent about the energy use of their infrastructure and set public targets for using renewable power in their data centres. The IEA has already shown that efficiency improvements can reduce the footprint per hour of streaming, but these gains might slow down as demand keeps increasing [6]. Platforms could nudge users towards less wasteful behaviour, for example by defaulting mobile streams to a sensible quality level, encouraging downloads for repeated viewing and avoiding unnecessary autoplay of trailers. None of these steps would ruin the user experience, but together they could reduce the total impact significantly.

Finally, I think streaming companies need to think more carefully about their role as gatekeepers of culture. This includes being more transparent about recommendation algorithms, supporting local and minority content instead of only promoting what already performs well, and giving users more ways to control what they see. Even small interface changes, like showing why something was recommended or letting users easily adjust what kind of content they want more or less of, can help people feel more in charge instead of passively fed by the system [10].

In the end, the ethical problems of streaming are not a reason to go back to DVDs. The technology has real benefits, especially in terms of access and convenience. But the current model often concentrates power and information on one side and leaves users, creators and even the environment carrying risks they didn't fully choose. An ethical streaming ecosystem would make it just as easy to leave as to join, would treat data with care, would share value more fairly and would be open about its environmental and cultural impact. None of these changes are impossible. They just require platforms to see ethics as part of good design, not as something separate from it.
