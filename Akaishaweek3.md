# Ethical Considerations – Akaisha

Subscription-based apps are everywhere now, from Netflix and Spotify to software and even online shopping. They’re convenient, but there are a few ethical issues that come with them. Some are good for users, while others can be unfair or manipulative.

## Pros

Subscriptions make things easier for people who can’t afford to pay a big price all at once. Paying monthly or yearly can help more people access what they need, like streaming, music or software. It spreads out the cost instead of forcing people to buy something outright.

They also push companies to keep their services updated and working well. Since people pay regularly, the company has to keep improving things or users might cancel. This makes them more likely to fix bugs, release updates and add new features to keep subscribers happy.

Some companies also try to be more responsible by being honest about their prices and by running their business in a more sustainable way. A few focus on using renewable energy or reducing waste, which shows they’re thinking about more than just profit.

## Cons

A big issue is that some companies make it hard to cancel subscriptions. They make signing up super easy, but cancelling can be confusing or hidden. People sometimes get charged without realising it because the system is designed that way. It feels unfair and takes advantage of users.

There’s also the problem of how companies use people’s data. Subscriptions collect a lot of information like email addresses, card details and viewing or usage habits. If that data isn’t protected or is sold to others, it becomes a privacy concern. Companies should be honest about what they collect and give users control over it.

Another issue is the emotional pressure companies use to keep people subscribed. They might add guilt messages or try to make people feel bad for cancelling. That’s not fair and shows they care more about profit than respect for customers.

## Summary

Subscription-based apps can be useful when they’re honest, easy to cancel and careful with data. But when they hide information, use tricks to keep users paying or collect too much data without consent, that crosses an ethical line. Companies need to focus on fairness and transparency if they want users to trust them.
