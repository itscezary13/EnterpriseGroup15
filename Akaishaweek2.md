# Scientific Viewpoint – Akaisha

From a scientific side, streaming services have changed a lot because of how data and video tech have improved over time. When we watch something online, it gets turned into digital data that travels through the internet using compression so it doesn’t take up too much space. Codecs like H.264, H.265 and AV1 help make videos load faster and look better even with less data.

Cloud systems also play a big role since streaming companies use big data centers to store and send out movies and shows all over the world. Better servers and internet speeds make it run smoother for everyone.

There’s also the science behind how much energy streaming uses. Data centers need a lot of electricity and cooling, so many companies are now trying to use cleaner energy and smarter tech to waste less power.

The science behind streaming keeps improving every year, helping it become faster, more efficient and better for the planet.
