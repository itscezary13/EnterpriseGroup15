# On-Demand Streaming (Mid-2000s to 2010s)

Back in the mid-2000s, people were still watching DVDs or downloading stuff from iTunes, but that started to change fast. Streaming came in and completely flipped how we watched and listened to things. Instead of waiting for downloads or going to buy discs, you could just click and start watching right away.

## The Early Start

In 2007, Netflix added a new feature called “Watch Now,” which let users stream movies and shows online for the first time. It wasn’t perfect — you could only use it on Windows and there weren’t many titles — but it was the start of something big. Around the same time in the UK, the BBC launched iPlayer so people could rewatch TV shows they missed. These two services showed that streaming was the future.

## Growth and Popularity (2008–2010)

Streaming really started growing after 2008. Apple added iTunes Movie Rentals, Hulu launched in the U.S. with ad-supported shows, and Netflix started appearing on TVs through Roku and Xbox 360 apps. That made streaming way more convenient — you didn’t have to use a computer anymore.

Meanwhile, Spotify launched in 2008 in Europe, changing music forever. Instead of downloading or pirating songs, you could just stream them instantly. Spotify’s free and premium options made music easier and more accessible to everyone.

## Why It Took Off

A few things helped streaming take off: internet speeds got way better, more people had broadband, and new devices like smart TVs, phones, and consoles made streaming possible everywhere. Basically, tech finally caught up with the idea of instant access.

## The Business Shift

Streaming also changed how companies made money. In 2010, Netflix introduced a $7.99 streaming-only plan, showing that DVDs were becoming old-fashioned. Hulu kept the ad-supported model, while Spotify made freemium popular. These new business ideas made streaming cheaper and more flexible for users.

## Originals and the Start of Binge-Watching

By the early 2010s, streaming services began making their own content. Netflix’s *House of Cards* (2013) was a turning point — it dropped all episodes at once, encouraging binge-watching and proving streaming platforms could compete with traditional TV networks. This kicked off what we now know as the streaming era.

## Summary

Between 2007 and 2013, streaming evolved from a small experiment to the main way people watched and listened. Faster internet, better tech, and new money models made it all possible. Netflix and Spotify basically set the foundation for today’s streaming world — everything available instantly, on-demand, anywhere.
