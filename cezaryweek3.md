week 3

Ethical Pros:
- subcription based streaming makes content more broadly available: anyone with a smart device can consume content.
- services such as Spotify share their revenue with artists based on their popularity (the more pupular you are the higher revenue you get)
- moving to digital media lowered the amount of waste (things such as CD disks are no longer needed to consume media)

Ethical Cons:
- Fair Pay concerns: artists earn less from streaming than they did from physical music / movies 
- Monopolization: a few companies dominate the market make it almost impossible for an idependent media company to exist without fostering a good relationship with them. 
- A lot of content is digital only creating a divide between digitalised and non digitilised world. 
- Data privacy concerns and possibilility of data breaches
- Streaming can push a certain world view making it seem like the new 'normal' - it's a powerful tool that can be misused if in wrong hands.
