## Ethical Reflection and Improvements

When streaming moved from a nice extra to the normal way people watch and listen, it didn't just change entertainment, it changed power. Companies like Netflix and Spotify now sit in the middle of how we access films, series and music. That creates a lot of ethical questions that are easy to ignore because everything feels quick and convenient for the user. In this section, I'll be looking at some of the main problems I see with the current streaming model, and then suggest changes that could make it fairer and more responsible.

One of the most obvious ethical issues is how hard it can be to leave a service once you've joined it. Many digital platforms have been criticised for using dark patterns, which are design tricks that push people into choices they might not have made if everything was clear and simple. A recent review of online services in Europe found that a large majority of sites and apps still use at least one dark pattern in their design, often hiding information or making some options much more confusing than others [[1]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/01/amazon-ends-prime-cancellation-dark-patterns-europe/). We can see the same problems in big subscription services. For example, Amazon had to settle a major case in the US after regulators accused it of using deceptive designs that made Prime easy to join but much harder to cancel [[2]](https://www.reuters.com/legal/amazon-duped-millions-consumers-into-enrolling-prime-ftc-2023-06-21/). Even if streaming platforms are not breaking the law, it is still a problem if users feel like the system is set up to keep them paying rather than respecting their choices. A model that depends on people forgetting to cancel or getting lost in menus isn't just annoying, it's ethically weak.

Another serious issue is data and transparency. Streaming services track what we watch, when we watch it and on which devices. So in theory, this is to improve recommendations, but it also turns our behaviour into a valuable resource for the company. This becomes an ethical problem when people aren't properly informed about what is collected and why. In 2024, the Dutch Data Protection Authority fined Netflix 4.75 million euro because the company failed to clearly explain to customers how their personal data was being processed and didn't give good enough answers when people asked what information was stored about them [[3]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/dutch-watchdog-fines-netflix-not-properly-informing-customers-about-data-use-2024-12-18/). To me, this shows that even very large and experienced companies still treat privacy as something they can fix later rather than a basic responsibility. If users don't understand how their viewing history and profile data are used, they can't really give real consent and they can't judge the risks for themselves.

There is also a fairness problem when we look at who benefits from the streaming model. For users, subscriptions feel cheap because the cost is spread out. For big platforms and very famous artists or studios, the system can be extremely profitable. However, many smaller musicians and independent creators say they receive only a tiny amount per stream and that it's almost impossible to earn a living unless they have millions of plays. Recent reports suggest that Spotify pays only a few dollars per thousand streams on average, while other platforms pay a bit more, and that most of the money still flows to a small group at the top [[4]](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/22/spotify-announces-royalty-changes). At the same time, some artists are leaving the platform altogether because they feel the company’s decisions, such as investing heavily in other industries, don't match the values of the creative community that actually generates the content [[5]](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/22/spotify-announces-royalty-changes). When the people who make the work feel exploited or ignored, that raises ethical questions about how streaming platforms share value and how much control creators really have.

Another ethical dimension is the environmental impact. Compared to producing and shipping DVDs, streaming looks clean because everything is digital. But the video still has to travel through data centres and networks that use a lot of energy. The International Energy Agency estimated that one hour of video streaming in 2019 produced around 36 grams of CO2 on average, which sounds small until we remember that billions of hours are streamed every year [[6]](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/29/streamings-dirty-secret-how-viewing-netflix-top-10-creates-vast-quantity-of-co2). The World Economic Forum has also highlighted how the rapid growth in internet traffic from video, games and calls is pushing data infrastructure to keep expanding, which means more servers, more cooling and more electricity [[7]](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/data-centres-energy-consumption/). Streaming is still generally better than everyone buying physical copies, but it's not impact free. When a whole industry moves to this model, I think it's fair to expect companies to show clearly what they're doing to keep the footprint as low as possible.

For users, there's also a quieter ethical issue around control and dependence. When we bought DVDs or CDs, we owned something that couldn't just suddenly vanish. With streaming, access is linked to contracts, licences and algorithms that the user doesn't see. Films and series can disappear overnight when deals change. Music can be removed after disputes. Whole libraries are sometimes reduced because a platform wants to cut costs [[6]](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/29/streamings-dirty-secret-how-viewing-netflix-top-10-creates-vast-quantity-of-co2). This makes culture feel temporary and fragile, even though it sits in huge corporate archives. It raises questions about who gets to decide what's available, what's promoted and what quietly drops out of sight [[6]](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/29/streamings-dirty-secret-how-viewing-netflix-top-10-creates-vast-quantity-of-co2).

If streaming services want to be more ethically solid, they have a lot of realistic options. The first and most obvious one is to fix cancellation and sign up flows so that they're genuinely balanced. Cancelling should be possible in one or two clear steps from the account page, with straightforward language and no guilt messages. Regulators in the EU and US are already moving in this direction, but platforms could choose to lead rather than wait to be forced [[8]](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/10/federal-trade-commission-announces-final-click-cancel-rule-making-it-easier-consumers-end-recurring). Making exit as easy as entry would show that companies are confident in their value instead of relying on confusion.

Second, platforms need to treat privacy as part of the product, not as an afterthought hidden in a long policy. They could just provide a simple dashboard where users can see the main categories of data that are stored about them, why each category exists and how long it's kept. Inspired by the Netflix case, they could also provide clear tools so that people can easily request, download or delete their data without going through a complicated support process [[3]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/dutch-watchdog-fines-netflix-not-properly-informing-customers-about-data-use-2024-12-18/). This wouldn't just reduce the risk of future fines, it would show respect for users as people rather than just as data points.

Third, there's room for more ethical innovation in how money is shared with creators. One idea that's already being discussed is a user centric payment model where a subscriber’s fee is divided only between the artists or shows they actually consume, instead of going into one big pool [[9]](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/03/soundcloud-announces-overhaul-of-royalties-model-to-fan-powered-system). This wouldn't magically fix the problem of low overall payouts, but it might feel fairer and give niche creators a better chance if they have a small but loyal audience. Platforms could also be more open about their revenue splits and commit to minimum payment levels or bonus schemes for independent creators, instead of keeping the exact formulas vague [[4]](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/nov/22/spotify-announces-royalty-changes).

On the environmental side, streaming companies should be more transparent about the energy use of their infrastructure and set public targets for using renewable power in their data centres. The IEA has already shown that efficiency improvements can reduce the footprint per hour of streaming, but these gains might slow down as demand keeps increasing [[6]](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/29/streamings-dirty-secret-how-viewing-netflix-top-10-creates-vast-quantity-of-co2). Platforms could nudge users towards less wasteful behaviour, for example by defaulting mobile streams to a sensible quality level, encouraging downloads for repeated viewing and avoiding unnecessary autoplay of trailers. None of these steps would ruin the user experience, but together they could reduce the total impact significantly.

Finally, I think streaming companies need to think more carefully about their role as gatekeepers of culture. This includes being more transparent about recommendation algorithms, supporting local and minority content instead of only promoting what already performs well, and giving users more ways to control what they see. Even small interface changes, like showing why something was recommended or letting users easily adjust what kind of content they want more or less of, can help people feel more in charge instead of passively fed by the system [[10]](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/27/movie-buying-owning-amazon-prime-lawsuit).

In the end, the ethical problems of streaming are not a reason to go back to DVDs. The technology has real benefits, especially in terms of access and convenience. But the current model often concentrates power and information on one side and leaves users, creators and even the environment carrying risks they didn't fully choose. An ethical streaming ecosystem would make it just as easy to leave as to join, would treat data with care, would share value more fairly and would be open about its environmental and cultural impact. None of these changes are impossible. They just require platforms to see ethics as part of good design, not as something separate from it.
