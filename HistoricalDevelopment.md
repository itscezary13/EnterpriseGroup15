Many believe that physical media consumption bloom in the 1960s when Lou Ottens, who worked for Philips, proposed the first ever audio cassette at the 1960 Berlin Radio Show (1). This relatively compact device enabled listening portably, which challenged the domination of vinyl records at the time (2). Towards the end of the 1970's the idea of a portable music player was further looked into by Sony, which introduced the famous Walkman in 1979 (3). This device was a small cassette player that turned listening to music into an individual experience. The popularity of the Walkman had an impact on the music scene with the popularisation of the so-called "Mixtape Culture" (4). In the early 1980's the two technological giants decided to work together to create the Compact Disc, more commonly known as a CD. The collaboration was a success as in 1982 the format was brought to marker with the introduction of Sony's CDP-101 player (5). CD became the most popular physical format in the early 1990's (6).

Meanwhile, the video media market had a revolution of its own. In the mid-1970's Sony has released the VHS format which quickly became the standard way to consume content (10). The VHS tapes were later reimagined into DVD's in the 1990's Similarly to CD's, they were a more compact and convenient way to consume media. 

The rapid changes did not slow down in the 90s as researches at the Fraunhofer Institute developed the MP3 file format. It was a way to compress audio recordings to reduce sizes of files while preserving music decent quality of media (7). The reduction of the sizes of music files enabled easier file sharing between users. We quickly entered the 'Peer-To-Peer' era by 1999 with the introduction of a file sharing platform called Napster (8). The software's users were able to share MP3 files between each other completely for free. This meant that one CD sale could be distributed between hundreds on Napster. As you can imagine, music rightsholders were not thrilled with the development. The platform faced many legal troubles in the years succeeding its premiere. It is estimated by the RIAA that around $15 Billion of revenue was lost because of Napster in the US alone. In 2001, the service was shut down due to a court's verdict (9). 

In the early 2000s it was clear that the idea of free, accessible and unlimited media was simply too good to forget for the consumers. Digital formats (mainly MPEG-1 and MPEG-4) let work begin on first video streaming platforms (11). 2000's also saw the birth of legal digital music. Most notably, Steve Jobs' Apple has launched the iTunes Store which offered legal music downloads for as low as 99 cent per song. Alongside the store, the company also released the iPod, a device able to play mp3 files through headphones without physical media carrier (13). In 2005 Google's YouTube has launched offering mostly user-generated video content. Towards the end of the 2000s Netflix shifted from DVD rentals into subscription-based VOD. On the music front, Daniel Ek introduced Spotify which offered licenced music available through internet. The app's business model is known as freemium meaning that it operates for free with ads with an option of a paid plan (12). 

Streaming media grew in popularity after 2008. Apple introduced iTunes movie rentals and Netflix expanded to TV apps on Roku and Xbox. Main reason why streaming grew so much in popularity were the advancements in internet speeds. Broadband was a lot more common in households. By early 2010s streaming services stopped purely licensing content. Netflix's 2013 classic "House of Cards" was a revolution of how media is consumed releasing all of its episodes at once. 2010s are usually known as the streaming era in terms of media consumption. 

There was a lot of criticism of streaming, particularly in the music industry. After Spotify went global in 2011, the platform amassed 15 million paying by 2014 (14). Plenty of artist criticised the platform for, what they felt like, unfair pay system. Most notably, American star Taylor Swift pulled her entire catalogue from the platform in protest (15). Many artists would follow suit but because of Spotify's growing popularity most of them would come back, including Swift. A solution to the paying disputes was proposed in 2017 by American rapper Jay-Z with the launch of Spotify's competitor named Tidal. On launch he promised higher music quality combined with better pay for artists. Upon premiere many artists would release their albums exclusively on Tidal, examples include Kanye West's 'The Life of Pablo' or Rihanna's 'Anti'. Despite the heavy promotion, Tidal would never see success comparable to that of Spotify. 

The streaming marker saw a lot more competition over the next years beginning the era of so-called "streaming wars". Media distributors and rightsholders preferred to launch their own services (Warner Bros launched HBO Max and Disney had Disney+) rather than licensing their content to maximise revenue. This offered variety but took away one of streaming's first pros, ability to watch whatever you want wherever you want. In the current state of streaming, paying for all available services would cost the same, if not more, as traditional means like cable or DVD's. Especially with the introduction of ad tiers and bundles, streaming starts to resemble the product it aimed to replace in the first place.
