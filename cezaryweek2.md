Subscription-Based Streaming (2010’s onwards)
Origins: Streaming originated in the late 2000s as a cheaper and more convenient alternative to consuming content through on-demand streaming. General public simply did not want to pay for music, movies and shows which enables pirate services such as Napster to thrive. It was obvious that the music and film industries could not function in the landscape filled with privacy so they had to act fast. 

Netflix, launching in 2007, offered users a small library of titles they could watch anywhere at any time as much as they want. Rather than carrying a box of DVDs, the consumer could now simply load the Netflix website and dive into a world of entertainment for a small, fixed and monthly price. 

In the music industry, Spotify’s Daniel Ek came up with the idea of a streaming service that will offer all of world’s music free of charge, although ad supported. Ek knew that times when people were willing to pay north of €10 for an album were long gone. To go ahead with his idea, he had to convince the giants of music distribution – Warner, Sony and Universal. To put it simply, they weren’t thrilled with the idea of free music being consumed legally. As piracy grew more and more common however, both sides knew they had to come to some sort of an agreement. That’s how Spotify’s “Freemium” model was born – Free with Ads (and other limitations) or unlimited for a fixed fee. General public has loved the idea and turned Spotify into an international success. 

Mainstream Adoption: Subscription based streaming rapidly moved from being something niche and experimental into a mainstream phenomenon in the early 2010s. Netflix more than doubled its paying subscriber base from just under 20 million in 2011 to over 40 million just 2 years after. This signalled that subscriptions were here to stay. 

In 2013 Netflix has released “House of Cards”, the first major exclusive original series. With crucial acclaim and Emmy nominations, this showed us that streaming platforms would not only stop at licensing content from elsewhere but would always compete with traditional TV by self-producing content. 

Other than Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have also joined the subscription market. They were first of many similar platforms, which gave customer more choice and more content variety. Amazon’s then “Instant Video” (now “Prime Video”) came bundled in with their Prime service. By that point everyone knew that subscriptions were the future.

In the music industry, Spotify went global in 2011, after becoming increasingly popular in the European markets. Wider adaption of smart devices and 4G connectivity enabled millions of users to access any song they wanted at any time. By 2014 Spotify had over 40 million monthly users, 10 millions of which were subscribed to their Premium plan. 

Subscription Dominance: Seeing the success of Netflix, Spotify and others many companies felt left out. Over just a few years Apple, Disney and YouTube have all either released or announced their versions of subscription based media streaming platforms (Apple Music, Disney+ and YouTube Music)

However it wasn’t all roses for music media streamers in the late 2010s. Many of the artists have critised Spotify for unfair pay compared to their pre-streaming era earnings. Most notably, Taylor Swift has pulled her entire catalogue from Spotify in 2014 because of pay disputes. Many have followed suit, however because of how popular streaming would become a vast majority came back. 

To fight the pay disputes a well-known rapper Jay-Z has launched his own music streaming service called Tidal. He promised great level quality and better pay for artists, launching with exclusive rights to some popular albums such as Beyonce’s “Lemonade”, Kanye West’s “The Life of Pablo or Rihanna’s “Anti”. Despite all the marketing and promotion Tidal never grew quite as far as Spotify. 

Streaming wars: Starting in 2019, a new era in media streaming has emerged often referred to as the Streaming Wars. Disney+, Apple TV+, HBO Max, Paramount+, Peacock and many more have launched during that time. Suddenly media distributors (such as Warner Bros, Disney and NBC) preffered to stream their media themselves rather than lending licenses to streaming services. This offered great variety in the market, however, the ability to watch whatever you want would now cost more than the traditional forms such as cable or DVDs. 

To fight this many companies introduces things like ad-tiers and bundles which resembled old cable deals. Streaming was no longer this new shiny idea but now felt like something old and reused.
