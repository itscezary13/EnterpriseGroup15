Business Viewpoint:

Advantages:
Music industry businesses had fixed monthly revenue from subscription rather than having to rely on releases
Music was accessible to a bigger number of consumers
Businesses could advertise themselves on the platforms
Businesses could use user data for research
Customer would pay for the app even if they don't listen to music as much / they forget to cancel
Brand loyalty - if you build your music library on a streaming app you're going to keep paying to ensure access
Ability to charge extra for premium quality - lossless audio, 4k resolution, number of downloads allowed
Services such as Netflix can develop content based on what the general public likes / is interested in

Disadvantages:
Streaming services (especially the likes of Netflix, Disney+ etc.) are now expected to release new content very frequently because of how competitetive the market has become
Businesses can't make big money with a release anymore, they can only increase or maintain what they already are getting per month
Piracy - general public can feel that if paying isn't owning then piracy isn't stealing
Dependence on technology - a server dysfunction could cause major issues
High costs of content licensing, especially for Spotify and services alike which pay around 70% of their revenue to the rightsholders - the more they earn the more they pay
