## Second Viewpoint Analysis: Business Perspective

From a business point of view, streaming has changed a lot about how entertainment companies work. Before all of this, most companies relied on people buying DVDs, CDs or digital copies. They made money only when something new was released. Once streaming became normal, everything shifted to monthly payments instead of one-time purchases. This gave companies a steady income, which makes planning much easier for them.

Netflix is a good example of how powerful this model can be. In 2024, they added over thirteen million subscribers in just one quarter, which led a lot of analysts to say Netflix was clearly leading the streaming industry at that point [[1]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/netflix-soars-earnings-highlight-dominance-streaming-wars-2024-01-24/). When a company grows like that and knows that money is coming in every month, it becomes a lot more confident in spending on new shows, films and global expansion.

Music streaming shows the same idea. Spotify has almost seven hundred million monthly users now and still holds the largest share of the music streaming market. It also stays ahead of Apple Music and Amazon Music, which shows how competitive the industry is and how hard it can be for smaller platforms to even survive [[2]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/spotifys-daniel-ek-become-executive-chairman-soderstrom-norstrom-named-co-ceos-2025-09-30/) [[3]](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/uk-watchdog-launch-investigation-into-music-streaming-2021-10-19/). Most people just pick the biggest service because it has the most content, and this makes the gap between companies even wider.

There has also been a big shift in what customers are actually paying for. Instead of owning something permanently, people now pay for access. In the UK, streaming became more than half of record label income by 2018, which shows how fast this model took over [[5]](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/21/streaming-accounts-for-more-than-half-uk-record-label-income). Some people argue that the value feels different now because the moment you stop paying, everything disappears. The Guardian pointed out that this can make people question what they are really buying when they subscribe to a service like this [[4]](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/02/streaming-spells-the-end-of-the-ownership-era-of-music-but-are-we-ready-to-let-go).

Another major issue is content licensing. Platforms like Netflix cannot offer the same shows in every country because rights are sold separately. This is why different regions have different libraries. A lot of users have tried using VPNs to get around this, but Netflix has had to block them due to pressure from studios and regulators [[7]](https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/in-asia-netflix-trips-on-regulation-content-and-competition-idUSKCN0XJ0D2/). On top of that, many major studios have removed their shows from Netflix to start their own platforms. Shows such as Friends and The Office were pulled when the owners launched competing services, which forced Netflix to spend more on original content [[6]](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/02/netflix-faces-losing-licensed-hit-shows-to-streaming-rivals).

Competition in the streaming industry has increased quickly. Disney Plus is probably the best example. It reached one hundred million subscribers in around sixteen months and, when combined with Hulu and ESPN Plus, even passed Netflix at one stage. Disney used its big brands like Marvel and Star Wars, and this helped them grow extremely fast [[8]](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/11/how-disney-overtook-netflix-in-streaming-wars). Because of this, companies have had to spend even more on exclusive content to keep people subscribed.

Investor pressure affects streaming platforms too. Netflix had a major stock drop in 2022 after losing subscribers for the first time in years. Investors were worried about the future, and this pushed Netflix to introduce new plans like a cheaper option with ads and restrictions on password sharing [[9]](https://www.reuters.com/technology/netflix-feels-heat-pandemic-boom-fizzles-2022-04-20/). Spotify has faced challenges as well. It pays a lot in royalties, which makes it harder to make a profit. However, Spotify reported its first annual profit in 2024 after raising prices in more than one hundred fifty countries and expanding further into podcasts and audiobooks [[10]](https://www.reuters.com/business/spotify-forecasts-profit-above-estimates-user-growth-price-hikes-2025-11-04/).

Looking at the business side of streaming shows both the benefits and the difficulties. The model helps companies grow quickly and reach global audiences, but it also comes with issues like licensing restrictions, rising costs, tough competition and constant pressure from investors. If streaming companies want to stay strong in the long run, they need to balance growth with stability while still thinking about what users and creators need.
